My fathers 85 and has severe hearing loss - he has tried hearing aids which at first helped but loss has become worst - has loss the hearing on one ear - hearing aids seem to cause him lots of pain
I now see that he now can't hear and is becoming isolated, which concerns me and makes me very sad and afraid he'll become very depress and not care.
