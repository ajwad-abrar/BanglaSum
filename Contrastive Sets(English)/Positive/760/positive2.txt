I was told by my family doctor, that I have total alopecia, I feel it was related to a hair color that I used in 2012, but seems there are no studies about chemical exposure from the coloring to prove my point of total hair loss, not sure about any study being done in this regard, mine was not a painless hair loss, I had burns to my scalp.
