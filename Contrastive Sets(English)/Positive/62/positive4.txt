My brother is 58 years old and has a spinal cord problem. He cannot move both legs and is in a wheelchair. His legs are very heavy as he has had one urinary tract infection after another. Now, the test is positive and the infection, which is still ongoing, cannot clear up, so his doctor cannot give him treatment for his main problem (spinal cord).
