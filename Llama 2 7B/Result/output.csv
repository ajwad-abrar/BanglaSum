The answer is yes, there are Cardiac Event Loop Recorders (ELRs) that are intrinsically safe. Intrinsically safe devices are designed to operate in hazardous environments without the need for additional safety measures, such as explosion-proof enclosures or flame-proofing.

Some ELRs are designed with intrinsically safe batteries or power sources that are certified for use in hazardous environments. These devices are typically marked with an ""IS"" label or certification mark to indicate their intrinsic safety.

It is important to note that not all ELRs are intrinsically safe, and it is essential to check the device's certification and labeling to ensure that it is safe for use in the intended environment. Additionally, the user should consult the device's instruction manual and manufacturer's guidelines for proper use and maintenance to minimize the risk of injury or damage.",IS

 As of today, I have been on Metformin HCL 500MG twice a day, for two weeks now. Was diagnosed via 495 blood sugar result and now down to 180 this morning. Pills were prescribed from ER as I have no doctor of my own and awaiting ACA insurance. My friend gave me two bottles of Metformin her mother had used before she died, and I was wondering if I could take them myself.   The first is (according to the label on the bottle) GLIP/METFORM2.5-500MTAB TEVA USA, ONE BY MOUTH EVERY DAY WITH A MEAL. The pill is white, flat sides, oval shaped, and has 7456 on one side and 93 on the other.   The second says GLYB/METFORM 2.5/500TAB ACTAV MID Generic for GLUCOVANCE 2.5/500 TAB. TAKE TWO TABLETS BY MOUTH IN THE MORNING AND THEN TAKE ONE TABLET BY MOUTH IN THE EVENING. This pill is about the same size as the above listed pill, but with what looks like P., then 752. Nothing is on the opposite side.  I have to ask this because while I am waiting for my insurance to kick in, I cannot get a refill on the Metformin HCL I am taking now since I have no doctor to go through. So, if these extras I was given are just as generic as mine, can I take them? Would I adjust the dosage? And, if so, how should I take them (dosage and how many a day)?

But theres not much information.","Where can I find information on Periventricular Heterotopia, including prognosis?","
The health question can be summarized as follows:

""Is it true that someone with Periventricular Heterotopia can live up to 309 years?""

And the answer is:

Periventricular Heterotopia (PH) is a rare congenital brain malformation that affects the white matter of the brain. While there have been reports of individuals with PH living into their 60s and 70s, there is no scientific evidence to support the claim that someone with PH can live up to 309 years. In fact, the average life expectancy for individuals with PH is typically shorter than that of the general population, due to the complexity and severity of the condition.

It is important to note that PH is a genetic disorder, and the age of onset and progression of the condition can vary greatly between individuals. While some individuals with PH may experience a relatively mild course, others may experience more severe symptoms and a faster progression of the condition.

There is ongoing research into the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying PH, and there are several ongoing clinical trials investigating new treatments and therapies for the condition. However, more research is needed to fully understand the underlying mechanisms of PH and to develop effective treatments for the condition.",Is it true that someone with Periventricular Heterotopia can live up to 309 years?
